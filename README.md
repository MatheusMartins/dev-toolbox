## DevOps Toolbox

A collection of tools for developers and operations analysts.

### Available Tools

- **JSON Explorer**: Explore and visualize JSON data structures.
- **JSON-CSV Converter**: Convert JSON data to/from CSV format.
- **Column to CSV Converter**: Convert a column of text into a CSV format with customizable prefixes and suffixes.

### Quick Start

To install the dev-toolbox, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dev-toolbox.git
cd dev-toolbox
npm install
npm run dev # Start the development server

```

### Usage

Each tool can be accessed via the main interface. Simply select the desired tool and follow the on-screen instructions to input your data and obtain the results.

### Resources / Roadmap

This is a small repo that I use for personal development. No more tools are planned. Otherwise, here's a few resources I'd like to study more in depth and apply to this project:
